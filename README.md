Home Insurance Database Management System

## Database Purpose:
The objective of the Home Insurance Database is to maintain acquired data and establish a foundation for an organization to strategically analyze existing and potential client information thereby speeding up the underwriting departmentâ€™s decision making and risk evaluation. The database can be used by all the departments (finance, legal, claims, underwriting, marketing) present in the organization. The database can assist in the diversification of finances, investments and calculating policy premiums, tracking policyholder details, property condition, and policy features resulting in continued growth and sustainability.

## Business Problem Addressed:
  - Maintain (enter, update, and delete), track, and report detailed information for each potential new case, enable the easy access and detailed analysis of the database.
  - Evaluate house conditions and risk of getting damaged based on the company's internal rating system. Provide an initial insurance price combining information of internal possessions values, community environment as well as house insurance history.
  - Query the information of any popular insurance coverage across a certain demographic from the database which can be helpful to provide valuable information to build and expand product marketing strategies
  - Optimize the insurance coverage pricing strategy and maintain a balance between a high gross profit rate and a high customer engagement rate.
  - Extract customer source reports from the database and estimate advertisement efficiency in different platforms like social media, house agencies and flyers.
  - Generate data to analyze customer's features like address, age, education, and credit scores to figure out insurance preference in different customer segments. Then design more effective marketing strategies.
